Hi ! 
<p>
My name is <b>Evan Jannot</b>, I am an engineering student at the <i>ENSC</i> in Bordeaux, France. 
My field of study is <b>cognitive sciences</b>, which leads me to conduct computer science projects of different types (AI, web programming, object-oriented programming, ...). 
</p>
<p>My main programming languages are <b>C#</b>, <b>Python</b> and <b>JavaScript (React, ReactNative, Node.js)</b>.
But I am always looking to learn new things and improve my skills.
</p>
<p>
  I also make mock-ups with <b>Figma</b>, in order to have good skills in UX design and human system interface.
