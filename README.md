Hi ! 
<p>
My name is **Evan Jannot**, I am an engineering student at the *ENSC* in Bordeaux, France. 
My field of study is **cognitive sciences**, which leads me to conduct computer science projects of different types (AI, web programming, object-oriented programming, ...). 
</p>
<p>My main programming languages are **C#**, **Python** and **JavaScript**.
But I am always looking to learn new things and improve my skills.
</p>
<p>
I also make mock-ups with Figma, in order to have good skills in UX design and human system interface.
